osmbot
======

An fork of emacen's OSM bot written in Python (no relation to the real Xybot).

scripts/dup_houses.py
=====================
The dup_houses bot allows you to draw buildings over house points and it will transfer the tags to them.
this is good for tracing over buildings where the house numbers are already in place.
